# Browser State Verification Fix

## Problem
The browser initialization and verification system in the experimental MCP server is failing because it's trying to call the `verify_browser_page` method, but this method doesn't exist in the actual `Tools` module implementation - it only exists in a placeholder implementation within `expiremental-new.py`.

## Solution
1. Implement the `verify_browser_page` method in the `Tools` package's `base.py` file with proper browser verification logic.
2. Add helper method `is_browser_alive` to check browser responsiveness.
3. Ensure proper error handling and recovery during browser initialization.
4. Maintain consistency with the browser persistence improvements.

## Implementation Details
The fix adds two new methods to the `PlaywrightBase` class in `base.py`:
1. `is_browser_alive` - Checks if the browser is still responsive
2. `verify_browser_page` - Verifies and recovers the browser and page state if necessary

These methods are designed to handle a variety of edge cases:
- Browser not yet initialized
- Browser initialized but no longer responsive
- Missing browser or context objects
- Missing pages array or invalid page index
