# Playwright Tools Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive testing plan for the Playwright tools in the MCP-enhanced-test project. The tests are designed to verify the functionality of all available tools using the prompts provided in `prompts.md`.

## Test Organization

Each test will follow a standard structure:
1. Initialize PlaywrightTools
2. Perform the sequence of actions from the prompt
3. Validate the results
4. Clean up resources

## Test Execution Strategy

1. Single Tool Tests: Focus on testing one tool at a time
2. Integration Tests: Test multiple tools working together
3. Error Handling Tests: Test recovery from errors
4. Performance Tests: Test tools under load

## Expected Results

Each test should:
1. Execute without errors
2. Produce expected results (screenshots, text content, etc.)
3. Clean up resources properly
4. Report any issues encountered

## Testing Against expiremental-new.py

All tests will be executed against the `expiremental-new.py` server implementation to validate the integration of the tools with the MCP protocol.
